## Logs are for humans to read. 

But there's a catch! They're a lot easier to read and process and query if you emit them in structured log form. This in turn makes your logs harder to read for humans. `humanlog` solves this by prettifying your structured logs!

Install `humanlog` with:
```
curl -L "https://humanlog.io/install.sh" | sh
```

Or follow the [instructions on the repo](https://github.com/humanlogio/humanlog#humanlog).
